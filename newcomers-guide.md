## Making a RPG-stat-block
### What is this RPG-stat-thingy
RPG-stat-blocks are templates to create object in a RPG game system, if you have something containing game data and used by the system (like character sheet, object stat, npc, spell ...) it's a RPG-stat-block in WA.
These block are mainly community sourced, and anyone grandmaster and up can add new blocks.

### Recquirements 
To make a RPG-stat block you will need to :
- have the game system into WA, if it's not already the case you need to ask **Dimitris** to add it.
- Read the documentation (keep going)
- Have some knowledge of or learn some HTML and TWIG template
- Have some knowledge of or learn some CSS (optional)
- If you choose to use YAML Data Model, have some knowledge of or learn some YAML (optional)

You will need some sort of text editor or better yet a IDE.
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free IDE with good Twig / Bootstrap plugin.
as for text editor Dimitris highly recommend [SublimeText2 or 3](www.sublimetext.com).
