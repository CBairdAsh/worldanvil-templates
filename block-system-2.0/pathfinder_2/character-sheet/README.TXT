
putting all the spells into the spellbook is nice for reading up, but there is no tracking of used spells yet

GORKAM's original version:

	old-display.html.twig

meta.json

	not sure if that is finished, inventory should not go there at all except really special items that might be in the public stat blocks later
	Theme Features?
	Class Features?

what i've found is missing:

	Magic Traditions
		ARCANE OCCULT
		PRIMAL DIVINE
		PREPARED SPONTANEOUS

	hit points block:
	    dying
	    wounded

	spell slot block:
	    cantrip level

	Innate Spells
	Focus Spells
